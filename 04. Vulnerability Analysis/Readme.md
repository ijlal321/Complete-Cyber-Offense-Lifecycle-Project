## Tools and Techniques Used

### **Finding First Vulnerability With Nmap Scripts**

   - Nmap scripts (NSE scripts) are custom scripts used to automate tasks and gather information during Nmap scans.
   - To find vulnerabilities using Nmap scripts, use the following command:

     ```
     nmap -p 1-65535 --script vuln target_ip_address
     ```

   - Replace "target_ip_address" with the IP address of the target system. Nmap will use vulnerability scripts to identify potential vulnerabilities.

   - For Example i will use this script on Metasploitable

   - Ofcourse we are on metasploitable, so we got alot of vulnerabilities.

### **Searchsploit**

   - Searchsploit is a tool used to search for known exploits and vulnerabilities in the Exploit Database (exploit-db.com).

     ```
     searchsploit vulnerability_name
     ```

   - Replace "vulnerability_name" with the name or keyword related to the vulnerability you want to search for. Searchsploit will display relevant exploit information.

### **Nessus Installation**

   - Nessus is a comprehensive vulnerability scanning tool used for identifying security issues within networks and systems.
   - To install Nessus, follow the official installation guide provided by Tenable, the company behind Nessus.

     ```
     sudo dpkg -i Nessus-<version>-debian6_amd64.deb
     ```

   - Replace "Nessus-<version>-debian6_amd64.deb" with the appropriate Nessus package file name.

### **Discovering Vulnerabilities With Nessus**

   - After installing Nessus, access the Nessus web interface and configure scans to discover vulnerabilities within target systems.
   - Create a new scan policy, select target hosts, and initiate vulnerability scans to identify security issues.

## Conclusion

The "Vulnerability Analysis" project has demonstrated techniques and tools used in vulnerability assessment, including Nmap scripts for initial vulnerability discovery, manual analysis with Searchsploit, installation and usage of Nessus for comprehensive vulnerability scanning, and targeted scanning of specific systems such as Windows 7 machines. Understanding and analyzing vulnerabilities are critical steps in enhancing cybersecurity posture and mitigating potential risks effectively.
