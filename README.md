# Complete Cyber Offense Lifecycle Project

This repository contains a series of projects related to cybersecurity, covering various stages of the cyber offense lifecycle. Each project focuses on different aspects such as setting up a hacking lab, reconnaissance, information gathering, scanning, vulnerability analysis, payload generation, exploitation, and gaining access.

## Important Note

- Each project is followed by tutorials from **Zaid from Z-Security** , providing in-depth guidance and explanations.
- Feel free to explore each project folder for detailed documentation, code examples, and tutorials.

## Projects Overview

1. **01 - Setting Up Our Hacking Lab**
   - Introduction to setting up the environment for cybersecurity assessments.
   - Includes steps for installing VMware Workstation, downloading Kali Linux, and configuring the virtual machine.

2. **02 - Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**
   - Exploring tools and techniques for gathering critical data in cybersecurity assessments.
   - Covers information gathering, IP and physical address retrieval, website scanning, email harvesting, and username discovery.

3. **03 - Scanning**
   - Understanding scanning techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities in target systems.
   - Includes Netdiscover, Nmap scans, operating system detection, and service version detection.

4. **04 - Vulnerability Analysis**
   - Identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities within target systems.
   - Covers Nmap scripts, manual vulnerability analysis, Nessus installation, and vulnerability scanning with Nessus.

5. **05 - Payload Generation**
   - Creating and manipulating payloads for penetration testing and ethical hacking scenarios.
   - Includes generating payloads with Msfvenom, Veil, TheFatRat, and making payloads open an image.

6. **06 - Exploitation & Gaining Access**
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining unauthorized access to target systems.
   - Covers exploitation techniques, gaining access with viruses and trojans, and post-exploitation activities.
